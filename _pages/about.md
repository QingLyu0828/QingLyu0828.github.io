I am a graduate student in Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Since 2017, I have joined Prof. Ge Wang's [AI-based X-ray Imaging System Lab](https://wang-axis.github.io/). I mainly focus on deep learning based magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction related studies, such as fast MRI, MRI super-resolution, cardiac MRI motion artifact reduction, and so on. I have been acting as the reviewer for MICCAI 2020, IEEE Transactions on Computational imaging, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, and IEEE Access.

Education
======
* B.S. in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, 2009-2013
* M.S. in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, 2013-2016
* Ph.D. in Rensselear Polytechnic Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering, 2017-now

Research interest
======
* fast MRI: using deep learning to post-process under-sampled MRI images to improve image quality and boost the acquisition process.
* MRI pulse sequence optimization: using neural networks to design personalized pulse sequences for patient's MRI scan.
* cardiac motion artifact reduction: training recurrent networks to extract spatio-temporal features for motion artifact reduction.
* cardiac motion prediction
* multi-contrast synthesis
* contrast enhancenment prediction
