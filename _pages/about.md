I am a graduate student in Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Since 2017, I have joined Prof. Ge Wang's [AI-based X-ray Imaging System Lab](https://wang-axis.github.io/). My primary research interest is in combination of medical imaging with deep learning for diagnosis and treatment. I have been acting as the reviewer for MICCAI 2020, IEEE Transactions on Computational imaging, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, and IEEE Access.
